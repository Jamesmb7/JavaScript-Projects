**Tic-Tac-Toe Game:**

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic. It randomly rolls dice to select which two placers will go first, and then users are off to play the game against one another or the computer depending on how the code is set up. My version was created to play against the computer, making it easy to play with on your own. 

**Calculator:**

This is a very basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a web version of a calculator. 

**Pizza Menu:**

This project is a menu used to order pizza with a varios selection of toppings. It then takes that information and calculates a price for the order.

**Portfolio Website**

This project was a creation of a website for me, as a way to showcase some of the skills learned throughout my work. It involves a combination of HTML, CSS, and JS while showing a little bit about who I am and what I am looking forward to in my future. It is interactive through JS and includes a form allowing anyone to contact me through the webpage.
